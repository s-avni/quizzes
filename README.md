# About
A project for quickly creating quizzes. Steps for creating your own quiz:

1. add a quiz file in /src/data (see the other quizzes for instructive examples including inserting code snippets, inline code, and images).
2. add the reference to quiz in /src/index.js

That's it!

## TODO
* Format files nicely (UI)
* Add tags/chips to quizzes in main page (just waiting on a UI framework for this)
* (Nice to have) Refreshing browser should return you to current page (not start of quiz)

### Command

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
